## 🧱 HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW

We are building a **simple TCP server** using **Java's standard libraries**, designed to:

* Wait for a client to connect (via TCP/IP)
* Send a greeting: "Hello from the server"
* Then close the connection
* Repeat this process indefinitely

It is **single-threaded**, meaning it handles **only one client at a time**.

---

## 🔍 CODE EXPLANATION IN DEPTH

---

### 🧩 `package SingleThreading;`

* This declares that the class is part of a package named `SingleThreading`.
* **Why?** In Java, packages are used to organize code into namespaces. It’s like having folders for different modules of your project.

---

### 📦 `import ...`

These are Java's built-in libraries for:

* `java.io` – input/output (reading/writing to/from sockets)
* `java.net` – networking (server/client sockets)

#### Key imports:

* `ServerSocket` – listens for incoming client connections
* `Socket` – represents a connection between client and server
* `BufferedReader`, `InputStreamReader`, `PrintWriter` – handle text input/output

---

## 🏗️ `public class Server`

This is a Java **class**, used for **encapsulation**. All code in Java must be inside a class.

**Why use a class?**

* To logically group related methods and fields
* To follow Java's object-oriented nature
* Allows easier reuse, testing, and extension (like multithreading later)

---

## 🧠 `public void run() throws IOException`

### This method contains the main server logic.

Let’s break it down step-by-step:

---

### ✅ `int port = 8010;`

* Sets a port number where the server will **listen** for incoming TCP connections.
* Port numbers range from 0 to 65535. Common ones like 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) are reserved. So we use a custom one here.

---

### 🧏‍♂️ `ServerSocket socket = new ServerSocket(port);`

* Creates a `ServerSocket` object.
* This socket binds to the port `8010` and starts **listening for incoming connections**.

---

### 🕒 `socket.setSoTimeout(10000);`

* Sets a timeout of **10 seconds** (10,000 milliseconds).
* This means `socket.accept()` will wait at most 10 seconds for a client to connect. If no one connects in that time, it throws a `SocketTimeoutException`.

---

## 🔁 `while(true)`

Infinite loop. Keeps the server running **forever**, handling one client per loop iteration.

---

## 🔒 try-catch block (within the loop)

Used for exception handling. Any errors during network I/O are caught to prevent the program from crashing.

---

## 📞 `Socket acceptedConnection = socket.accept();`

* **Blocking call**: Waits until a client connects.
* Returns a new `Socket` object representing the **client connection**.
* Now the server can read from/write to this socket.

---

## 🪪 `acceptedConnection.getRemoteSocketAddress()`

* Gets the IP address and port of the **connected client**.
* Useful for logging or debugging.

---

### 🧾 I/O Streams

#### `PrintWriter toClient = new PrintWriter(acceptedConnection.getOutputStream());`

* Creates a **character-based output stream** to send text to the client.
* `PrintWriter` is convenient for writing formatted text.

#### `BufferedReader fromClient = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(acceptedConnection.getInputStream()));`

* Creates a **buffered character input stream** to receive text from the client.

> Note: In this example, you're not actually reading anything from the client; this setup is done just to show a typical server structure.

---

## 💬 `toClient.println("Hello from the server");`

* Sends a simple string message to the client.
* Since this is a **TCP connection**, the client will receive it reliably.

---

## 🔚 Clean-up Code

```java
toClient.close();
fromClient.close();
acceptedConnection.close();
```

* Closes the output stream, input stream, and socket.
* **Why?** Proper resource management. Not closing streams/sockets can lead to memory leaks or open ports piling up.

---

## ❗ Exception Handling

```java
catch(Exception ex){
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

* If anything goes wrong during accepting, reading, or writing, the stack trace is printed.
* This helps developers understand what failed.

---

## 🚀 `public static void main(String[] args)`

### This is the entry point of any Java application.

#### Inside it:

```java
Server server = new Server();
try {
    server.run();
} catch(Exception ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

* You create an instance of your `Server` class.
* Call the `run()` method to start the server.
* Wrap in `try-catch` to handle any top-level exceptions.

---

## 🧠 CONCEPTUAL NOTES

### Why use a class here?

Java is an **object-oriented programming (OOP)** language. So:

* All code must be inside a class
* Classes group related data (fields) and behavior (methods)
* A `Server` class allows encapsulating the server’s behavior for better organization

### Why Single Threading?

* Simplicity: easier to understand and debug.
* Limitation: can only handle one client at a time. Others must wait.
* In real-world servers (like HTTP servers), **multithreading** is used to handle many clients simultaneously.

---

## 🔄 What Happens When a Client Connects?

1. Client sends a TCP request to port 8010 on the server.
2. `socket.accept()` unblocks and returns a `Socket` for the new connection.
3. Server sends back `"Hello from the server"` via `PrintWriter`.
4. Connection is closed after sending the message.
5. Server waits for the next client.

---

## 👀 Visual Diagram:

```
+--------------------+
|   ServerSocket     |  <-- Listens on port 8010
+--------------------+
          |
          |  socket.accept()
          v
+--------------------+
|      Socket        | <-- Connected to 1 client
+--------------------+
| InputStream        | <-- Reads data from client
| OutputStream       | <-- Sends data to client
+--------------------+
```

---

## ✅ What You Could Add Later:

* Read actual input from the client
* Make it multi-threaded
* Add logging
* Implement a simple protocol (e.g., command-based chat)

## Questions

### Q1. what is does   `Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept()`?

Ans. When `socket.accept()` is Called The server pauses here and waits. This is called a blocking call — it blocks further execution until a client tries to connect.
When a client (e.g., a browser, or Java client code using Socket) connects to port 8010, the operating system.

when Client Tries to Connect . It Accepts the TCP connection and Assigns it a new ephemeral port (temporary)
Creates a new Socket object representing that connection

Once a client connects: `accept()` unblocks and Returns a Socket object that’s connected to the client
You now have a dedicated communication channel between server and that client

---


### Q2. `acceptedConnection.getRemoteSocketAddress()` what it does ?

Ans. It return something like that `/192.168.1.10:52347` . 

Which means:
IP Address: 192.168.1.10 – the IP address of the client

Port: 52347 – the temporary (ephemeral) port number assigned by the client system

This is read-only, informational data that tells the server who connected to it.



```java
PrintWriter toClient = new PrintWriter(acceptedConnection.getOutputStream());
```

This line is responsible for **sending data (text)** from the **server to the client** over a **TCP socket**.

------------


### Q3. explain this line `PrintWriter toClient =new PrintWriter(acceptedConnection.getOutputStream())`;

#### ✅ `acceptedConnection.getOutputStream()`

* This retrieves the **raw output stream** (type: `OutputStream`) associated with the socket.
* It is used to **send bytes** from the server to the client over the network.
* But working with bytes directly is low-level and not convenient for writing text.


#### ✅ `new PrintWriter(...)`

* `PrintWriter` is a **high-level writer** class in Java that wraps around a stream.
* It allows you to easily **send text** (strings, numbers, etc.) to the client using methods like:

    * `print()`
    * `println()`
    * `printf()`

> Think of `PrintWriter` as a fancy version of `System.out`, but instead of printing to your console, it prints over the **network** to the **client**.



#### ✅ So why wrap the `OutputStream`?

* `OutputStream` deals with **bytes**
* `PrintWriter` deals with **characters and strings**
* Wrapping it allows you to do:

```java
toClient.println("Hello from the server");
```

Instead of manually converting strings to bytes like:

```java
outputStream.write("Hello".getBytes());
```

---

#### 🧠 Full Purpose of This Line

This line sets up the ability to **send human-readable text** from server to client:

```java
PrintWriter toClient = new PrintWriter(acceptedConnection.getOutputStream());
```

> Now `toClient` is a stream you can write to, and the client will receive it as network data.



#### ⚠️ Gotcha: Buffering

By default, `PrintWriter` is **buffered**. This means:

* It stores output in memory first
* Doesn't immediately send it unless:

    * You call `flush()`
    * Or call `println()` (which auto-flushes on some platforms)
    * Or set **auto-flushing** to true when creating it

So, better version:

```java
PrintWriter toClient = new PrintWriter(acceptedConnection.getOutputStream(), true); // auto-flush on println
```

| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `acceptedConnection`            | Socket connected to the client                      |
| `.getOutputStream()`            | Gets the raw output byte stream                     |
| `new PrintWriter(...)`          | Wraps it in a higher-level writer for text output   |
| `toClient.println("...")`       | Sends text to the client via TCP                    |
| Optional: `true` in constructor | Enables **auto-flushing** on every `println()` call |

---

### 🧪 Example Use

```java
PrintWriter toClient = new PrintWriter(acceptedConnection.getOutputStream(), true);
toClient.println("Welcome to the server!");
```

This sends `"Welcome to the server!"` to the client, and the client can read it with a `BufferedReader`.

-------------


### Q4. `acceptedConnection.getOutputStream()` what it does?
Ans. that line is very important in **receiving data from the client** over a TCP connection.


```java
BufferedReader fromClient = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(acceptedConnection.getInputStream()));
```

It creates a **character-based, buffered reader** that allows the **server to read text data** (like lines or strings) sent from the **client** over the socket.



#### 🧱 Step-by-Step Breakdown



#### ✅ `acceptedConnection.getInputStream()`

* Returns a **raw input stream** (`InputStream`) from the socket.
* This stream receives **bytes** sent by the client.
* It’s a low-level stream — not convenient for reading text directly.



#### ✅ `new InputStreamReader(...)`

* Wraps the `InputStream` and **converts bytes to characters** using a character encoding (default is usually UTF-8).
* Turns a **byte stream** into a **character stream**.

So this part:

```java
new InputStreamReader(acceptedConnection.getInputStream())
```

means:

> "I want to read **characters** (like text) instead of raw bytes from the client."



#### ✅ `new BufferedReader(...)`

* Wraps the `InputStreamReader` to add **buffering** and powerful methods like:

    * `.readLine()` – reads a full line of text
    * `.ready()` – checks if data is available to read
    * `.read(char[] cbuf)` – reads into a character array

So now you can do:

```java
String message = fromClient.readLine();
```

Which will read an entire line of text from the client.



#### 🧪 Analogy

Imagine reading a letter:

* **`InputStream`** = raw bytes, like reading the paper letter character by character using a magnifying glass
* **`InputStreamReader`** = reads whole words by interpreting characters (converts bytes → letters)
* **`BufferedReader`** = reads whole lines, efficiently, like reading full sentences at a time

---

#### 🧪 Example Use

Here’s how you’d use it:

```java
BufferedReader fromClient = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(acceptedConnection.getInputStream()));
String clientMessage = fromClient.readLine();
System.out.println("Client says: " + clientMessage);
```



#### ✅ Summary

| Part                             | Role / Purpose                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `acceptedConnection`             | Socket connected to the client                              |
| `.getInputStream()`              | Gets the byte stream from the client                        |
| `new InputStreamReader(...)`     | Converts bytes to characters                                |
| `new BufferedReader(...)`        | Adds buffering and lets you read full lines or chars easily |
| Resulting variable: `fromClient` | A reader to receive text data from the client               |



## 🔄 Data Flow (Client → Server)

```text
Client -----> Socket -----> getInputStream() -----> InputStreamReader -----> BufferedReader
```

-----------------

### Q5. What is **Auto-Flushing**?

**Auto-flushing** means that data written to a stream (like a socket or file) is **automatically sent** or **written out** after certain operations—like calling `println()`.

When auto-flushing is **enabled**, you **don’t have to manually call `flush()`** each time you want data to be sent out of the buffer.


#### 🧠 Why Flushing Is Important

When you use a `PrintWriter`, it buffers output (stores it in memory temporarily) to improve performance. This means:

* You might call `println()`, but **no data is actually sent** until:

  * You call `flush()` manually, or
  * The buffer fills up, or
  * You close the stream

This is a problem with **network sockets**, because the client or server may be **waiting for a response** that hasn't actually been sent yet (even though it looks like your code already sent it).


### 🛠️ Example: Without Auto-Flushing

```java
PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream());
// This sends nothing yet!
writer.println("Hello"); 
// Still nothing happens unless:
writer.flush(); // ← Now it’s actually sent
```
### ✅ With Auto-Flushing

```java
PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
writer.println("Hello"); // ← Immediately sent to the other side!
```

The `true` enables auto-flush on calls to `println()`, `printf()`, or `format()`.

---

#### 🚦 What Problem Does Auto-Flushing Solve?

It prevents **"hanging" or freezing behavior** in network communication where:

* One side is waiting for data that the other side *thinks* it already sent—but it’s still sitting in a buffer.

In your case:

* The **server** wrote to the client, but didn’t flush.
* The **client** waited for a response (`readLine()`), but nothing arrived.
* So the program just sat there — frozen.


#### 📌 Summary

| Feature               | With Auto-Flush (`true`) | Without Auto-Flush (default) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Data Sent Immediately | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No (must call `flush()`)   |
| Prevents Hanging      | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No                         |
| Good for Sockets      | ✅ Recommended            | ❌ Risk of bugs               |
